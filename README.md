# waldo-anticheat
A project that aims to use optical flow and machine learning to visually detect cheating or hacking in video clips from fps games.

## The What
A new market for cheats that are visually indistinguishable to the human eye have led to a rise in "closet hacking" among streamers and professionals.
This form of cheating is very hard to detect. In some cases, nearly impossible to detect due to the humanized aim assist coming from another system entirely. 

We will combat this new kind of cheating by creating our own deep learning program to detect this behavior in video clips.

## The How
Because of the advanced technology used, the only reliable way to detect this form of cheating is by observing the cheating behavior directly from the end result- gameplay. Our goal is to analyze the video directly using deep learning to detect if a user is receiving machine assistance.

Phase 1 focuses primarily on humanized aim-assist. Upon completion of phase 1, WALDO's main function will be vindication and clarity to many recent "hackusations."
